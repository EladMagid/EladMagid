        <div class="text">n The açaí palm, Euterpe oleracea, is a species of palm tree cultivated for its fruit,
             hearts of palm, leaves, and trunk wood. Global demand for the fruit has expanded rapidly in the 21st century,
              and the tree is cultivated for that purpose primarily.

             <h2> Are Acai Bowls Healthy?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="text">We know that acai is good for you, but what about acai bowls?

        This depends on a number of factors with the three most important being: topping choices, topping amounts, and overall serving size.
            
        With no toppings, one serving (or one acai bowl) will contain approximately 250 calories, 10 grams of fat, 30 grams carbohydrates, 7 grams fiber, 20 grams sugar, and 7 grams protein. Normally I would question anything with that much sugar, but knowing that it either comes from fruit or milk, I’m ok (you will have to decide this for yourself).
        Calories aside, the vitamins and minerals in this single bowl pack a huge punch.
        But the toppings…what about those toppings?

        If you plan to add granola, check the nutrition label. What you find may surprise you. Or, make your own homemade granola!
        Add less stuff when comparing your acai bowl against us food bloggers and Instagrammers. 
        I cant speak for all of us, but some of our bowls that claim to be “healthy” most definitely are not.
        Start with a smaller bowl to reduce the serving size.

            <div class="text">How to make an Acai Bowl
                Make this Acai Bowl in three easy steps,
                
                Freeze your fruit. Slice your banana and transfer it to a small baking sheet or plate lined with parchment paper. To the same plate, add the blueberries and strawberries (store-bought frozen fruit will work just as well). 
                Transfer tray or plate to the freezer and allow the fruit to freeze completely.
                Blend. Once frozen, add the milk and yogurt to the bowl of a large,
                high-speed blender with a tamper (see tips and tricks). Add the frozen blueberries, strawberries,
                banana, and broken up acai. With the blender on low, use the tamper to push the frozen fruit down,
                mixing around as much as possible. Continue to blend on low until smooth, only adding additional liquid when needed.
                Assemble. Divide the smoothie into two bowls and top with all your favorite toppings. Best enjoyed immediately (because it will melt).
